Big Picture Premium (BPP) Supershow Overlay
-------------------------------------------
Live stream announcer play by play app to assist viewers in understanding the
state of the Supershow card game match.  To start the match is between 2
competitors, future iterations could support tag teams (2 vs 2).  Ideally the
match sequence can be captured as well, for serialization in a future "replay
viewer".

Control view and production view, production view is shared with stream,
control view is only seen by controller, but sets the next state to show for
production.

I have the full card database I can package with this app, includes db for
attributes as well as image DB.  The app should be Python, should work on
Windows and Linux.  Control UI and Production UI should talk via sockets -
theoretically they can exist on same machine or on two different machines.

Competitor is clickable, cards are clickable for higher resolution image preview

Control view needs to be able to update quantity and text of cards in play,
discard, number of cards in hand, turns won, turns passed, last turn roll type
and number.  Ideally a record of the match would include all rolls, all cards
played and discarded, and statistics of match like number of turns won, passed.

The Control UI should capture the record of the sequence of events for a match.
There will need to be a button for turn phases:

Turn roll phase: both players roll.  Player that wins takes their turn.  They
will play a card, it might be stopped by the other player playing a stop card.
So cards should be able to be in play and removed from play quickly.  Also it
should be quick to clear the cards from in play to the discard pile.  Basically
a card can go from in hand (unknown what the card is when it is in the hand),
to in play, or into discard, and from discard it can go back to hand or buried
(into bottom of deck), or placed on top of deck, etc.

The Control UI does not need to be pretty, can be a basic Python UI.  The
Production UI needs to be polished and configurable, likely HTML5 frame.

Crowd Meter needs to be incrementable.  Title of match will be set at start of
match.  Stipulations as well.  Stipulations can be free form text for now.
